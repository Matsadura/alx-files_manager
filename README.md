This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

## Introduction

This guide covers key concepts and technologies used in building modern web applications, including how to create an API using Express, authenticate users, store persistent data in MongoDB, manage temporary data with Redis, and offload tasks to background workers for efficient processing. Each section will explain the underlying concept, its importance, and how it's typically implemented.

## Concepts

### 1. **Creating an API with Express**
   - **What is an API?**
     An **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows communication between different software applications. When building a web API, you provide a set of endpoints (URLs) that clients (like frontend apps or other services) can interact with by sending HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST).
     
   - **Why Express?**
     **Express** is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies building APIs by providing a robust set of features to manage routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities. It allows you to build scalable APIs quickly with minimal overhead.
     
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - **Routes**: Each route defines a path and the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interacting with the API.
     - **Middleware**: Functions that process requests before they reach your routes (e.g., for logging, authentication).
     - **RESTful Design**: A style of designing APIs that map HTTP methods to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### 2. **User Authentication**
   - **What is Authentication?**
     **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It’s crucial for securing sensitive data and restricting access to authorized users only. Common methods include username and password, OAuth, and token-based authentication.

   - **How It Works in Web APIs**:
     - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A commonly used method for securing APIs. After a user logs in, a token is generated and sent to the client. This token is included in future requests to authenticate the user.
     - **Session-based Authentication**: Another approach where the server keeps track of the logged-in user using sessions. This usually involves storing session data on the server or in a service like Redis.
     
   - **Why is it important?**
     Authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access certain resources or perform certain actions, making it essential for securing any web application.

### 3. **Storing Data in MongoDB**
   - **What is MongoDB?**
     **MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. It’s particularly well-suited for applications that need to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

   - **How it differs from SQL databases**:
     Unlike traditional SQL databases (which use tables, rows, and columns), MongoDB uses **collections** of **documents** (similar to JSON objects). This makes it easy to store and retrieve data without a predefined schema, providing more flexibility.

   - **Key Concepts**:
     - **Documents**: A document in MongoDB is akin to a record in SQL. Each document is a set of key-value pairs, typically corresponding to a single entity (e.g., a user or a product).
     - **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, which allows you to define schemas, manage validation, and interact with the database in a structured way.

   - **Use Case**: MongoDB is ideal for web applications where the data is dynamic and doesn't fit neatly into a traditional SQL schema (e.g., social media apps, e-commerce).

### 4. **Storing Temporary Data in Redis**
   - **What is Redis?**
     **Redis** is an in-memory data store used for caching, session management, and other temporary data storage needs. Because it keeps data in memory (as opposed to a disk), Redis provides extremely fast read and write operations.

   - **Why use Redis?**
     - **Speed**: Redis can serve data much faster than disk-based databases like MongoDB or SQL, making it perfect for use cases like caching frequently accessed data or storing session data.
     - **Expiration**: Redis allows you to set expiration times for keys, making it ideal for temporary data (e.g., storing user sessions or rate-limiting counters).

   - **Use Case Examples**:
     - **Caching**: Storing the result of expensive database queries temporarily to reduce load and improve response times.
     - **Session Management**: Storing user session data to maintain login state.
     - **Rate Limiting**: Counting API requests to enforce limits (e.g., max 100 requests per hour).

### 5. **Background Workers**
   - **What are Background Workers?**
     A **background worker** is a separate process that handles tasks outside the main flow of your application. When an operation takes too long (e.g., sending emails, processing large files), it’s more efficient to delegate it to a background worker. This prevents the API from becoming unresponsive or slow while handling the task.

   - **Why use background workers?**
     - **Efficiency**: By moving time-consuming tasks to the background, the API can immediately respond to the client without waiting for the task to finish.
     - **Scalability**: Background workers help distribute load, allowing your system to handle a high volume of requests or tasks without blocking the main application thread.

   - **How to Implement**:
     - **Message Queues**: Background workers often rely on task queues, where jobs are added to the queue and processed asynchronously. Redis can be used as a queue for background tasks.
     - **Libraries**: Tools like **Bull** (a Node.js library) are used to create and manage background workers. They integrate with Redis to track job status, retries, and failures.

   - **Use Case Examples**:
     - **Email Sending**: When a user signs up, instead of blocking the API to send a confirmation email, the email task is delegated to a background worker.
     - **Data Processing**: Large data processing tasks can be handled in the background while the user gets immediate feedback.
